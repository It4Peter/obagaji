                <p>Opiatoha g'Obagaji is a non profit organization dedicated to the community both in Otukpo, Obagaji and Agatu. It is an association of people who were living in Obagaji before but are now residing in Otukpo. Even though we are currently
                    living in Otukpo, we decided to organized ourselves to carry out projects that will promote peace and development at our alma-matter. The association was founded in April 2019. The first Chairman of the association was Mr. Ojema Olobo
                    Joseph and the current Chairman is Mr. Oyishoma Samson.</p>
                <p>The association have their meetings every fourteen (14) days (Sundays). Currently, Okabido Hotel, Otukpo is the venue where we meet for each meeting days. It is our pleasure for all Obagaji residents who are now in Otukpo to be part of
                    this organization. Together we will be able to help ourselves and those we left behind in Agatu through our numerous programmes, they will know we have not forgotten and will never forget where we came from. </p>
